# Crystal Collector
### A selection game that dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library

#### 06/09/18 - Dareen Mohamad

## Project Goal
The Crystal Collector game displays the use of the jQuery library to dynamically update HTML pages.  Included are events that capture the user's image clicks which execute through a sequence of logic of steps. This determines if the user's score has exceeded the score to be guessed until the user wins (guesses the score exactly) or exceeds the score.

## Project Usefulness
This project incorporates lessons of jQuery on how to correctly manipulate and select HTML elements within the DOM.
